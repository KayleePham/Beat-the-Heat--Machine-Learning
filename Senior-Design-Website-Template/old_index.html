                Our Senior Design Project will be based on developing a machine learning model that will be able to predict the creation and spread of wildfires.  Wildfires
                can be destructive and difficult to prepare for as they appear suddenly and spread rapidly.  In California, the occurrence of wildfires are relatively frequent
                due to the dry nature of the state.  By developing a machine learning model that can predict the creation and spread of wildfires, more people and their properties
                will be safe from the early preparations.

            <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
            <p>
                According to <a href="https://www.expert.ai/blog/machine-learning-definition/#:~:text=Machine%20learning%20is%20an%20application,use%20it%20learn%20for%20themselves.">expert.ai</a>
                machine learning is "an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. 
                Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves."  In short, machine learning is an application of AI that uses
                datasets to predict target outcomes on problems that would be difficult or nearly impossible otherwise.

            <h5>Fig 1: Project Design Overview</h5>
            <p>
                Our project is divided into three major phases: Preparation, Model Building, and Quality Measurement as shown in Fig. 1.
                The purpose of these three phases are to categorize each machine learning process into high-level chunks.  The major phases 
                in machine learning are the data, model buidling, and the evaluation phase. 
            </p>

            <h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>

            <h5>Fig 2: Project Preparation Design</h5>
            <p>
                In machine learning, the data phase is the most crucial phase because machine learning models use the data to form predictions.
                If the data is unusable or preprocessed incorrectly, the results will be inaccurate leading to an invalid project.  
                In this project, the Preparation Phase handles all the data related tasks.  The high-level tasks are

                The modeling phase in machine learning is when the machine learning algorithms are applied on the preprocessed data.  In most cases, the algorithms are 
                provided in various different API's and allows the users to import the packages, plug in the data, and use the algorithms with little effort.  The modeling 
                phase takes three types of sub-datasets from the data preprocessed stage: train, validation, and test sub-datasets.  The models are trained using the
                the train dataset, validated with the validation dataset, and tested using the test dataset.  The datasets used in the modeling phase are 
                constructed using historical dataset, so the models can derived or recognize patterns within the datasets.  In our project, the machine learning
                process is the same as the general stage.  We train, valid, and test the models using the three types of preprocessed datasets.

            <h2 id="evaluation">Quality Measurement</h2>

            <p>
                The evaluation phase in machine learning is the stage when the prediction results from models, during the modeling phase, are compared to the 
                actual dataset and evaluated for accuracy.  This is the phase when we explore the usability of the models.  There are a wide range of 
                evaluation metrics that can be used that also depends on the type of problem being tackled (classification or regression).  In our project,
                we will be using the classification metric, cross-validation and possibly regularization to validate and evaluation our models.
